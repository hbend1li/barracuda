Description: daemon that scans program outputs for patterns, and takes action
 A common use of reaction is to scan ssh and web server logs,
 and ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors.
 reaction doesn't have all the features of the honorable fail2ban,
 but it's ~10x faster and easier to configure.

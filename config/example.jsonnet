// tldr; when an `after` action is set in a filter, such filter acts as a 'jail',

// full;
// when a filter is triggered, there are 2 flows:
//
// if none of its actions have an `after` directive set:
// no action will be replayed.
//
// else (if at least one action has an `after` directive set):
// if reaction stops while `after` actions are pending:
// and reaction starts again while those actions would still be pending:
// reaction executes the past actions (actions without after or with then+after < now)
// and plans the execution of future actions (actions with then+after > now)
